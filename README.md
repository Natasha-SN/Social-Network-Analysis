**A. GITHUB SOCIAL NETWORK**

This dataset shows a large social network of GitHub developers which was collected from the public API in June 2019. Nodes are developers who have starred at least 10 repositories and edges are mutual follower relationships between them. The vertex features are extracted based on the location, repositories starred, employer and e-mail address.
